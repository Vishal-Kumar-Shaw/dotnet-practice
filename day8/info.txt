1️⃣ Factory Pattern ka main purpose?
2️⃣ Abstract Factory Pattern ka real use-case?
3️⃣ Factory Method vs Abstract Factory difference?
4️⃣ Open/Closed Principle kya hota?

The main purpose of factory pattern is to decouple the driver class with the actual class, Code maintainability and extendability, clean

The real use of Abstract Factory Pattern is UIThememodules

Factory creates concrete objects, but abstract factory creates factories that is used to further make objects

A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.


⭐ 1️⃣ Factory Pattern ka main purpose?
✔ Tumhara answer:

decouple the driver class with the actual class, maintainability, extendability

Perfect direction.

⭐ INTERVIEW-PERFECT VERSION:

Factory pattern ka main purpose object creation ko centralize karna hai,
taaki client code ko “new” se direct dependency na ho.

Benefits:

Loose coupling

Easy extension (Open/Closed Principle)

Maintainable and testable code

Swap implementation without modifying main logic



⭐ 2️⃣ Abstract Factory Pattern ka real use-case?
✔ Tumhara answer:

UI theme modules

This is 100% correct and the BEST real-world example.

⭐ Slight polish:

Abstract Factory real use-cases:

UI Themes → DarkThemeFactory / LightThemeFactory

Database Providers → SqlFactory / MongoFactory

Cloud Providers → AWSFactory / AzureFactory

OS Components → WindowsFactory / MacFactory

KEY POINT:
Abstract Factory ek family of related objects create karti hai.


⭐ 3️⃣ Factory Method vs Abstract Factory difference?
✔ Tumhara answer:

Factory creates concrete objects, but abstract factory creates factories

PERFECT — same line senior developers use.

⭐ Polished version:

Factory Method:
→ Creates one type of object.
→ Subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Abstract Factory:
→ Creates a family of related objects.
→ Provides multiple factory methods inside one super factory.

Short line:
👉 Factory Method = single object creator
👉 Abstract Factory = multiple related object creators


⭐ 4️⃣ Open/Closed Principle kya hota?
✔ Tumhara answer:

A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Correct + textbook perfect.

⭐ Polished explanation:

Open/Closed Principle ka matlab:

Existing code me changes nahi karne chahiye,
but new features add karne ka option always hona chahiye.

Factory pattern is the best example:

Naya payment method add karo → new class add karo

Existing factory code untouched if using polymorphism / dictionary mapping
