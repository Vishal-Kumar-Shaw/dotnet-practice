⭐ DAY 7 SHORT QUESTIONS (Theory Revision)

1️⃣ Abstract class vs interface in 2 lines
2️⃣ DI kyu use karte?
3️⃣ Constructor injection benefit?
4️⃣ Loose coupling kya hota?

Abstract class is class 1. whose object cannot be made 2. Can have properties and constructor 3. Can have concrete and abstract method
DI - DI is used to inject Object into Another Object by constructor While object creation. It is used to remove direct dependency of
one class to other and loose coupling
Constructor Injection Benefit - Loose coupling
Loose coupling - one class should not directly depend on other


✅ 1️⃣ Abstract class vs Interface (in 2–3 lines)
✔ Tumhara answer (correct direction):

Abstract class ka object nahi ban sakta

Constructor + properties ho sakte

Concrete + abstract methods allowed

⭐ PERFECT INTERVIEW VERSION:
Abstract Class
Partially implemented class; can have fields + constructor + implemented + abstract methods.
Used when classes share common behavior.
Interface
Only contract/rules; no fields or constructor; multiple interfaces can be implemented.
Used for loose coupling + flexibility.


✅ 2️⃣ DI kyu use karte?
✔ Tumhara answer:
remove direct dependency → loose coupling
This is correct, but professional version:
⭐ PERFECT INTERVIEW VERSION:
Dependency Injection (DI) is used to:
Remove tight coupling (classes shouldn’t create each other)
Increase testability (mocking becomes easy)
Enable multiple implementations (Swap Email → SMS → WhatsApp easily)
Improve maintainability and solid architecture
Follow SOLID “D”: Dependency Inversion Principle



✅ 3️⃣ Constructor Injection Benefit?
✔ Tumhara answer:
Loose coupling
Correct but incomplete.
⭐ PROFESSIONAL COMPLETE ANSWER:
Constructor Injection gives:
Strong immutability → dependency set only once
Null safety → compiler ensures dependency provided
Testability → easy to inject mocks
Loose coupling → depends on interface, not concrete class
No hidden dependencies
This is why constructor injection is preferred over property or method injection.

✅ 4️⃣ Loose Coupling kya hota?
✔ Tumhara answer:
one class should not directly depend on other
Excellent.
⭐ PROFESSIONAL VERSION:
Loose coupling means:
A class depends on abstractions (interfaces) instead of concrete classes
You can replace implementations without modifying the main code
Improves flexibility, testability, and scalability
Example:
❌ Tight coupling:
var s = new SmsNotification();
✔ Loose coupling:
INotificationService s = new SmsNotification();
